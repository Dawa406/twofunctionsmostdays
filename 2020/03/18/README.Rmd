# `rversions::r_oldrel()` - i know this one!

```{r old, echo = TRUE}
library(rversions)

# When you submit a package to CRAN you need to say what environments and R versions you checked the package on
# If you use Travis-CI, the versions are called oldrel and release - but who can keep track of what those actually are?!

# Use r_oldrel() to see what version oldrel (the old release) is
r_oldrel()

# r_release() tells you what the current release is
r_release()
```

# `rversions::r_versions()` - new to me!

```{r new, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(rversions)

# r_versions() lists all R versions!
versions <- r_versions()
head(versions)

# When did the nicknames start?
# (psst: they're all Peanuts references https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/09/28/r-release-names/)
library(dplyr)
versions %>%
  filter(!is.na(nickname)) %>%
  filter(date == min(date))
```
