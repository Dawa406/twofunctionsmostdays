# `scales::dollar()` - i know this one!

```{r}
library(scales)

money <- c(1.50, 100, 1000, 40000)

# Give nice dollar formatting to some money!
dollar(money)

# You can change the prefix (or suffix!), the thousand separator, and decimal mark, too:
dollar(money, prefix = "\u20ac", big.mark = " ", decimal.mark = ",")
```

# `tidyr::full_seq()` - new to me!

```{r}
library(tidyr)

# A sequence, by 5, but missing 15:
x <- c(0, 5, 10, 20)

# Create the full sequence by specifying the gap between observations
full_seq(x, period = 5)

# Works with dates, too!
y <- as.Date(c("2020-01-01", "2020-01-03"))

full_seq(y, period = 1)
```
