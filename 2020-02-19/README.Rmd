# `janitor::clean_names()` - i know this one!

```{r old, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)

df <- tibble(
  Date = "2020-02-01",
  `Dollars Earned` = 10,
  `% Loss` = 5,
  `2020 Total` = 100
)

# Clean up the column names, make them easier (and safer!) to use!
clean_names(df)

# The default is snake_case, but you can change that too:
clean_names(df, case = "lower_camel")
```

# `slider::slide_dbl()` - new to me!

```{r new, echo = TRUE}
library(slider)

x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Make a "sliding" version of the sum function, summing the current value and the 2 values prior to it, and return the results as a double vector
slide_dbl(x, sum, .before = 2)

# Set .complete to FALSE to only compute the sum if there are *actually* 2 values before - otherwise, return NA!
slide_dbl(x, sum, .before = 2, .complete = TRUE)
```
